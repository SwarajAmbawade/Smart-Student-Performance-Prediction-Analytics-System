# Smart Student Performance Prediction & Analytics System

## Project Overview
The Smart Student Performance Prediction & Analytics System is a machine learning–based web application that predicts student academic performance using academic parameters such as attendance, internal marks, and study hours. The system also provides analytical insights through an interactive dashboard.

This project is designed to align with Azure Fundamentals concepts and Business Intelligence (Power BI–style analytics).

---

## Objectives
- Predict student academic performance (Pass / Fail)
- Generate confidence scores for predictions
- Classify performance into grades (A / B / C / D)
- Provide analytical insights using dashboards
- Design a cloud-ready and analytics-ready system

---

## Machine Learning Approach
- Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression
- Input Features:
  - Attendance (%)
  - Internal Marks
  - Study Hours per Day
- Output:
  - Pass / Fail prediction
  - Confidence Score
  - Performance Grade
